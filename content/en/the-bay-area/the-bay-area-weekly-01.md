## 750 Words

750 Words是《艺术家的方式》中所学到的晨间页面的数字版本，由 @buster  创立，用于日常记录私人日志，750 差不多是 3 页纸的字数。写作，可以在记录的过程中了解自己。

750 Words is basically a digital version of morning pages, an idea I learned about from Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way. It is founded by @buster for daily personal journaling. 750 is the words count of three standard pages. Learn about yourself in the writing process. Every day you write, you'll get beautiful stats that analyze the feelings, themes, and mindset of your words.

## Self experimentation

We all know that products can undergo AB testing to validate which experiment performs better. In fact, we can also experiment with certain ideas to validate them ourselves. For example, I once wanted to track my sleep time, intentionally increase or decrease my sleep time, observe my condition during the day, and find out how much sleep I actually needed.
