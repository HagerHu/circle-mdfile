<p>The way Kat run miss excel and structure her business is through energetics. This is what she did for creating, “I get my energy to a place where my presence is truly magnetic and I will get visions of what will go viral.

<p>The only way to get better at something is to keep doing it. Focus on the process and not the product. Focus on the process, and sooner or later, the product will follow. Do what makes you feel comfortable, but find some way to track your efforts.</p>
